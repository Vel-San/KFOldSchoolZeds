Scrake melee attack 1 should be preferred when raged on Suicidal+
Attack 1 deal less damage(20%?) as its faster and hits twice
Attack 2 deals slightly(15%?) more damage as it's slower
Rename all zed names to to "Zed Name 2.5"
No turning when knocked down(turn off targetting?)
Meleestun/Hit animation immunity during knockdown(they're knocked on their ass so they shouldn't suddenly stand up and start moving around)
Clot to use clawing animations on door instead of grappling
Zeds have buggier pathing compared to KF zeds for some reason, check controller class to see if any changes had been made to their hunting state
