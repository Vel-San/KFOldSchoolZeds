issues:
*door attack is wrong(slower than kfmod), but it's fine
*boss doesnt use correct needle, it's a minor visual error but that's fine
*maybe add a minigun idle anim for patty so he doesnt jitter when hes not firing? or revert to old behaviour where he mows people down?
*increase bloat puke range
*ranged pound is extremely strong in comparison to the husk, balance by accuracy, burst length, and mgdamage
*ranged pound animations sometimes break after firing and i cant fucking figure out why

*fleshpound and ranged pound have fucked up head hitboxes(scrake, patty, and siren kinda do as well)
 this is due to their animations, using any other animation such as the clot walk fixes them
 TODO: rework their bones to use modern anims?
 
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 TEMP HACK FIX TO BE MADE: EDIT MODEL IN 3DSMAX, MOVE HEAD BONE TO THE RIGHT A 1 METER OR SO.
 
 
Must fixes:
*fleshpound rage timeout doesnt work
